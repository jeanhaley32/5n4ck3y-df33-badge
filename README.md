**DefCon 33 5n4cky3**

This image was pulled from the `winbond 25Q128JVSM` SPI Flash Memory Chip on `Defcon 33s` 5n4ck3y CTF badge. 

This CTF starts here [ANDnXOR_DC33_Badge](https://github.com/ANDnXOR/ANDnXOR_DC33_Badge)

The starting position for this CTF is within a text adventure on a Z-machine file, the format used to host old Zork games, and can be access via an emulator. On Mac, you can use `frotz` easily with `brew install frotz` and execute with `frotz ./bender_ctf.z5`. 


The badge itself runs on a Raspberry Pi Pico.
